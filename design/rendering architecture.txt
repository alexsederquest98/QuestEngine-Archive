Heirarchy:

These interfaces will be implememented on a per-platform basis (OpenGL/Vulkan/DirectX)
IRenderDevice (interface for object creation - textures/buffers/shaders/etc) ~ creates objects on the device
IDeviceContext (interface for rendering commands) - drawindexed
ISwapChain ~ buffers to be rendered to the screen
ITexture (interface for textures, 2D/3D, cubemaps, texture arrays)
IBuffer (interface for buffers, index/vertex/uniform)
ITextureView ~ how the data should be used
IBufferView ~ ditto above
IPipelineState (interface for configurable stages) ~ depth, z, stencil, blend, rasterizer states are controlled here
IShaderResourceBinding - binds all resources needed by all shaders in a pipeline state
